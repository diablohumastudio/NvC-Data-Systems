This folder contains action_condition_system.gd, the file that describes a singleton used to manage the state of the app. It just reads a lot of Conditions and StateChanger, and call their funtions evaluate() and change_state() respectively. This clases with this funcions are design to change the state of the app. 

Conditions are meant to be evaluated and if is fullfilled emit a signal; so it's meant to be used inside some element that needs to react to the condition; but since it doesn't have a function to be reloading the conditions that are currently active, and we feed it with the result of loading from disk the conditions, its especifically design to be inside a piece of the state. We actually feed it with conditions from disk that we use them inside of files that are resources thar are going to be saved to user:// folder. That way pieces of state can change themselves in any way they wanted based on the result of one or many conditions. And the conditions since the are only require to have a funtion called evaluate where they emit a signal called fullfiled, it is super versatile and powerfull.
